----------------------------------------------
-- Changelog for version 1.1.0 (2023-07-24) --
----------------------------------------------
Fixed important bug in uploading post-mission data.

This bug would not allow uploading post-mission data from gRCS. This error displayed in the terminal the message "Something went wong!" and was due to 
the HTTPRequestWorker implementation when creating the message for the POST upload request.

----------------------------------------------
-- Changelog for version 1.0.4 (2023-07-05) --
----------------------------------------------
The changes of this version are small improvements after the release of the code and a the fix of a bug in the representation of the Inspection Areas.

* In DDHL, new fields have been added in the Inspection Location properties to define the Inspection Plan orientation in the global 
  reference frame: quatW, quatX, quatY and quatZ. These fields are read instead of the "repr" matrix to represent the Inspection Area.

* When using "Ctrl + Arrows Keys" to edit a waypoint manually in route editing mode the last one was moved. Now the one that is selected 
  in the gRCS is edited. 

* Added server response to the logging message when POST call fails during post-mission data upload.

----------------------------------------------
-- Changelog for version 1.0.3 (2023-05-21) --
----------------------------------------------
These changes are due to bugs reported by partners and some additional improvements.

* When saving the route to a text file, the ACTION type waypoint parameters are also saved.

* Implemented new functionality to download InspectionPlan based on the site. This avoids having to manually copy the InspectionPlan 
  UUID from the portal.

* Saving floating values as a string of 6 decimal places to avoid rounding errors when saving or loading paths from a text file.

* An inspection plan will only be uploaded to the gRCS when the associated asset has been successfully downloaded.

-- Changelog for version 1.0.2 (2023-01-13) --
----------------------------------------------
These changes are due to bugs reported after demonstrator pilots and minor improvements proposed by partners.

WAYPOINT EDITION
* [WTR] Now is possible to delete ACTION waypoints by right-clicking on them and using the drop-down menu. When an ACTION type waypoint 
  is deleted, the waypoints that were associated to its UUID will be reassociated to the immediately previous inspection task UUID.
* [WTR] Now you can also delete the POSE waypoint type placed on the Inspection Location with right click and the drop-down menu and you 
  will only be able to place a single POSE waypoint type.
* [ETH] It is no longer possible to modify the XYZ position of the ACTION waypoints from the Waypoint Editor Widget.


VISUALIZATION
* [WTR] Be able to modify the size of the waypoints label and hide the global frame axis in the 3D viewer. In addition, the option to 
  hide the UUIDs or texts of all items has also been added.
* [WTR] You can hide the shape of the home position (disk with arrow) through the Visualization Configuration Options. Whenever you are 
  in "home edition" mode it will be in visible mode.
* [WTR] You can now modify the transparency of Inspection Locations.
* [WTR] When the PCD of the point cloud is generated from the STL, now the point density is generated dynamically depending on the size 
  of the surface model. The number of points used is equal to the number of bytes in the asset.
* If a specific alarm is not received for 5 seconds, the alarm will be grayed out. In this way we make sure that we are receiving 
  alarms updates.


DDHL UPLOAD
* [USE] "When uploading post-mission data, sometimes the same data is uploaded twice in a row. This generates an error that the "sync_id" 
  already exists in the portal but the data has been uploaded correctly."
    - We are not able to reproduce this bug.


GENERAL BUGS
* [ETH] Allowed negative values in the parameters of the High Level Actions. Now the range is between [-999.0, 999.0]
* [WTR] HLAction piloting-mavsdk timeout.
    - Not been able to fix this bug yet.
* [USE] "To be able to have a single asset associated with several Inspection Plans in order to load them later. It is convenient to check 
  the distribution of local folders where this information is stored".
    - We are not able to reproduce this bug.

-- Changelog for version 1.0.1 (2022-06-03) --
----------------------------------------------

DISCLAIMER: It is necessary to update both piloting-mavsdk (5.0.1) and piloting-masdk-ros to the new latest versions.

WAYPOINT EDITION
* The Waypoint Heading Dialog has been modified to be able to set decimals in the orientation.
* Fixed autoheading default value bug. Sometimes defaults to start as enable.
* It will no longer be possible to change the waypoint type from the Waypoint Editor Widget.
* Now, in the Inspection Locations, right-clicking will select whether you want to add a POSE or ACTION waypoint type on that area. 
  This will be the only way to place waypoints type ACTION.
* When placing the first waypoint, in addition to the UUID, the name of the associated Inspection Task will be displayed.


VISUALIZATION
* The Waypoint Editor Widget has been modified. Now the parameters associated to the waypoint will be displayed according to its 
  type (POSE or ACTION). In addition, from this widget it will no longer be possible to change the waypoint type.
* The following functionalities have been added in the Visualization Config Options:
	- Hide the point cloud.
	- Modify the colour of the point cloud.
	- Hide the text of displayed items.
* Axes at ACTION waypoints have been removed, as they have no orientation.


DDHL DOWNLOAD
* STL to PCD conversion has been implemented.
* A dialog has been created to select the target asset file from the files list associated with Inspection Plan. The supported formats 
  of the 3D model are: PCD, PLY and STL.
* The possibility to connect to DDHL via a url has been added.


GENERAL 2ยบ INTEGRATION WEEK BUGS
* When downloading the robot waypoint list the orientation was not parsed. This has been fixed.
* Version information has been added to the gRCS.
* The local computer clock is shared with the Docker container to correctly generate the post-mission data.
* Information associated with MAVSDK commands has been added to the Docker container.  This will allow you to know the meaning of 
  each parameter in the high-level action commands.
* It is no longer necessary to place a HOME to send the route to the robotic system.
* Fixed piloting-mavsdk-ros sendCommand time-out bug when using commands.
* The associated task_type_uuid field has now been added to the waypoints items. This will allow to know the type of action to be carried 
  out in the wp type ACTION.
